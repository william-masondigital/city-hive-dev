Want to add this to your Nova instance? Read below:

# Installation

### 1. Meteor package
I would recommend that you clone this repo in your Nova's `/packages` folder. 

In `.meteor/packages` file, add at the end of the **Optional packages** section:
`xavcz:nova-forms-upload` 

*Note: You can also add it via the classic `meteor add xavcz:nova-forms-upload`, however you may encounter load order issue.*

### 2. NPM dependency
This package depends on the awesome `react-dropzone` ([repo](https://github.com/okonet/react-dropzone)), you need to install the dependency: 
```
npm install react-dropzone
```

### 3. Cloudinary account
Create a [Cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com) if you don't have one. 

The upload to Cloudinary relies on **unsigned upload**:

> Unsigned upload is an option for performing upload directly from a browser or mobile application with no authentication signature, and without going through your servers at all. However, for security reasons, not all upload parameters can be specified directly when performing unsigned upload calls.

Unsigned upload options are controlled by [an upload preset](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#upload_presets), so in order to use this feature you first need to enable unsigned uploading for your Cloudinary account from the [Upload Settings](https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/upload) page.

When creating your **preset**, you can define image transformations. I recommend to set something like 200px width & height, fill mode and auto quality. Once created, you will get a preset id.

It may look like this:

### 4. Nova Settings
Edit your `settings.json` and add inside the `public: { ... }` block the following entries with your own credentials:

```json
public: {
  
  
  "cloudinaryCloudName": "YOUR_APP_NAME",
  "cloudinaryPresets": {
    "avatar": "YOUR_PRESET_ID",
    "posts": "ANOTHER_PRESET_ID" // or maybe the same
  }


}
```

Picture upload in Nova is now enabled! Easy-peasy, right? üëØ

# Custom fields
You can now use the `Upload` component as a classic form extension with [custom fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yTT48xaSy8) like `nova:forms-tags` or `nova:embedly`.

## Image for posts
Let's say you want to enhance your posts with a custom image. In your custom package, your new custom field could look like this: 

```js
// ... your imports
import Telescope from 'meteor/nova:lib';
import Users from 'meteor/nova:users';
import Upload from 'meteor/xavcz:nova-forms-upload'

// ... your permissions
const canInsert = user => Users.canDo(user, "posts.new");
const canEdit = Users.canEdit;

// extends Posts schema with a new field: 'image' üèñ
Posts.addField({
  fieldName: 'image',
  fieldSchema: {
    type: String,
    optional: true,
    publish: true,
    control: Upload,
    insertableIf: canInsert,
    editableIf: canEdit,
    autoform: {
      options: {
        preset: Telescope.settings.get('cloudinaryPresets').posts // this setting refers to the transformation you want to apply to the image
      },
    }
  }
});

PublicationUtils.addToFields(Posts.publishedFields.list, ["image"]);
```

## Avatar for users
Let's say you want to enable your users to upload their own avatar. In your custom package, your new custom field could look like this: 
```js
// ... your imports
import Telescope from 'meteor/nova:lib';
import Users from 'meteor/nova:users';
import Upload from 'meteor/xavcz:nova-forms-upload'

// ... your permissions
const canInsert = user => Users.canDo(user, "users.new");
const canEdit = Users.canEdit;

// extends Users schema with a new field: 'telescope.avatar' üëÅ
Users.addField({
  fieldName: 'telescope.avatar',
  fieldSchema: {
    type: String,
    optional: true,
    publish: true,
    control: Upload,
    insertableIf: canInsert,
    editableIf: canEdit,
    autoform: {
      options: {
        preset: Telescope.settings.get('cloudinaryPresets').avatar // this setting refers to the transformation you want to apply to the image
      },
    }
  }
});

// publish this new field
PublicationUtils.addToFields(Users.publishedFields.list, ['telescope.avatar']);
```

Adding the opportunity to upload an avatar comes with a trade-off: you also need to extend the behavior of the `Users.avatar` methods. You can do this by using this snippet:

```js
const originalAvatarConstructor = Users.avatar;

// extends the Users.avatar function
Users.avatar = {
  ...originalAvatarConstructor,
  getUrl(user) {
    url = originalAvatarConstructor.getUrl(user);

    return !!user && user.telescope && user.telescope.avatar ? user.telescope.avatar : url;
  }
} 
```

## S3? Google Cloud?
Feel free to contribute to add new features and flexibility to this package :)

You are welcome to come chat about it [on the Telescope Slack chatroom](http://slack.telescopeapp.org)

## What about `nova:cloudinary` ?
This package and `nova:cloudinary` share a settings in common: `cloudinaryCloudName`. They are fully compatible.

Happy hacking! üöÄ
